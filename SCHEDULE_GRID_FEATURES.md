# Schedule Grid Future Features

## Bulk Schedule Builder (Planned)
- Add schedule shifts for a location across a date range.
- Assign multiple people at once (group selection).
- Select a crew to auto-fill the team.
- Optional: apply a pattern (time ranges, break rules).

## Notes
- Goal: reduce manual shift creation for large teams.
- Should support both single location and multi-location groups.
